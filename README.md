# Formal Languages and Automata

Made by Tomislav Ignjatov and Martin Popovski for our Formal Languages and Automata class at school

## Description

Simple pure javascript mixed with bootstra css classes. 

We made this web application when we were studying about Regular Expresions in our Formal Languages and Automata course
as a way to practise for the upcoming exam.

## Usage

Put some words in the Words window and add them to the True words or the False words accordingly and after that try to write a good enough pattern that will match all the True Words
and mismatch all the False Words. 

We used this app as a testing ground for regular expresions while practising for our exam.

## Hosting 
The app is currently live at http://martinkozle.com/fla/regex-checker/
